Welcome to my cybersecurity journey! My name's Pocholo, and I'm a recent graduate with a burning passion for all things tech and cybersecurity. When I'm not immersed in the digital world, you'll find me indulging in two of my favorite hobbies: conquering virtual realms in video games and savoring the delights of the culinary world. Join me as I navigate the exciting realm of cybersecurity while sprinkling in some gaming and gastronomic adventures along the way!
