#### Problem:
Instructions:
```
We found these weird number sets in a text file. Are they pointing somewhere? We arent sure..
Format: FLAG{xxxx}
```

#### Solution:
This is a tab-delimited file, with two columns. Plop them in Excel, and put them in a scatter plot. I put the rotated scatter plot in PowerPoint for easier viewing.
The dots on the scatter plot show the flag.
